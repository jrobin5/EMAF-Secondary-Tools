# EMAF-Secondary-Tools
EMAF Secondary Tools are a collection of MS Office and Visio Templates for developing Enterprise Architecture artifacts that can be imported into either DBM or ARIS (EMAF Primary Tools).

## Folder Structure
As these tools are based upon MS Office and Visio, folders are used to publish custom stencils and templates, and then the client software is configure to point to the following locations.
* My Shapes - main directory for storing custom Visio stencils
* My Templates - main directory for storing custom Visio and MS Office templates

NOTE: Each of the above folders can also house sub-folders for grouping similar stencils and templates.

## Publication and Distribution
As distributing a new release is manually done
* Shapes and stencils are zipped and published as follows
